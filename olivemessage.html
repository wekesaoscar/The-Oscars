    <h1>The Oscars open birthday letter to you</h1>
    <p class="message"><big>
        <p>
            Dear Olive, <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy birthday, my favourite! <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the very first moment I met you started talking to you and hosting you in my house for the maiden time that afternoon, I was captivated by the unique combination of qualities that make you who you are. Your beauty and personalities are some of the things that draw me to you constantly. Every time I see you, it feels like I’m looking at the outmost epitome of beauty, but it’s your heart and mind that truly make you exceptional. You possess a rare kind of radiance—one that goes far beyond looks and into the core of who you are. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Olive, your drive and passion for life are what make me admire you so deeply. The way you tackle challenges, never backing down from an opportunity to grow, inspires me every single day. I see how much effort you put into becoming the best version of yourself, and it motivates me to do the same. It’s this hunger to push forward and your relentless pursuit of self-improvement that has not only captured my heart but also made me look at life with a new sense of purpose. I love how you balance strength and grace, ambition and kindness, independence and love. You’re the type of person who always strives for more, and that is one of the many reasons I’m so drawn to you. You make me want to be better, to grow not just for myself, but for us. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you remember those days we spent together at my place? Every single moment was perfect. Having you around made everything feel complete, as though my house became more than just walls and a roof—it became a sanctuary filled with warmth, laughter, and joy because of you. Those days weren’t just regular days; they were some of the most meaningful moments I’ve ever experienced. Being close to you, sharing little moments, laughs, and even the comfortable silences was everything I’ve ever wanted. I treasure those memories, and they make me look forward to the future with you. I can’t wait to spend more days, weeks, months and hopefully even years with you. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I don’t see you for long periods, I genuinely feel like a part of me is missing. I miss everything about you—the sound of your voice, your smile, how I enjoy looking at you. There’s this emptiness that only seeing you again can fill. You’ve become such an important part of my life that being away from you feels like time is standing still. I crave your presence because it fills my world with light and happiness. I miss you more than words can say, and whenever we’re apart, it only reminds me how much you mean to me. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Olive, you are the woman I’ve always dreamed of. Your personality is a perfect match for everything I’ve ever wanted in a partner—kind, intelligent, driven, and compassionate. There’s no one else who could ever compare to you. I often find myself in awe of how lucky I am to have met someone like you. You’re not just my type, you’re everything I never knew I needed and more. Every day I applaud myself for finding the courage and reason that resulted to me stopping you and talking to you for the first time along that road leading to where you used to stay, and every day I’m reminded that I want you to be a part of my life in every way. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I want us to continue building our chemistry, not just as two individuals, but as a team. I want us to grow together, to support each other in everything we do. I’ve seen how far you’ve come in your own journey, and it makes me excited for the future. I know we can be each other’s strength, pushing one another to reach even greater heights. Being with you gives me hope for the kind of life we can build—a life filled with love, understanding and mutual growth. I believe in us, in what we can create together, and I’m committed to making sure we thrive both as individuals and as a couple. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being the incredible person that you are. Your presence in my life has been nothing short of a blessing, and every day I spend with you is a reminder of how fortunate I am to know you and keep fighting for you to be by my side always. I admire you more than you know, and my love for you grows deeper with each passing day. You are the woman I want to share my life with, the person I want to make memories with and the one I want to continue growing alongside. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            On your special day, I just want you to know that you very special and dear to me. I without doubt hold you very firmly close to my heart. There is no one else I would rather be with, no one else I would rather laugh with and no one else I would rather love. I’m so excited for what the future holds for us, and I know that together, we can achieve anything that we dream off. You’re everything I could ever want in a partner and you don’t know with how much relief that yes from you will bring to me. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you, Olive, yes am absolutely serious about that, I do actually love you without a doubt. Thank you for being the beautiful, strong and inspiring woman that you are. Looking forward to many more birthdays, more memories and an environment of love and growth together. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            With all my heart,<br>
