    <h1>The Oscars open apology letter to you</h1>
    <p class="message"><big>
        <p>
            Dear Dell, <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My Heartfelt Apology to You, Dell<br>
        </p>
       <p>
        I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. As I write this, my heart is heavy with the weight of my actions—or rather, my inactions—and the hurt I’ve caused you. I want you to know that this letter comes from the deepest part of my heart and every word is a reflection of my sincere regret and unwavering love for you.
       </p>
        <p>
            First, let me begin by saying how truly sorry I am for not calling you frequently enough. I realize that this lack of communication must have made you feel unimportant, neglected and perhaps even unloved. But please, Dell, believe me when I say that none of this was ever my intention. You are so precious to me and the thought of causing you pain weighs on my soul. I’ve allowed my actions—or lack thereof—to send the wrong message and for that, I am deeply sorry.
        </p>
       <p>
        I’ve also failed to show you the love you truly deserve. You have such a beautiful heart, filled with kindness and patience, and I’ve taken that for granted. You’ve stood by me through everything and yet, I haven’t reciprocated the way I should have. Love is about action, not just words and I see now how I’ve fallen short in demonstrating how much you mean to me. You deserve someone who shows you every single day how loved, cherished and appreciated you are. I vow to be that person moving forward.
       </p>
        <p>
            I know my behaviour has been frustrating. I’ve made mistakes that have hurt you, and each one fills me with regret. These mistakes, however, are not a reflection of how I feel about you. They do not mean that I don’t love you—far from it. My love for you is real, deep, and enduring. I’ve simply let my own shortcomings overshadow the love I have for you, and for that, I apologize with all my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dell, you mean the world to me. You’re my partner, my confidant and my greatest blessing. The thought of losing you because of my negligence terrifies me. I never want you to feel unappreciated or overlooked again. You are irreplaceable in my life, and I promise to show you that every single day from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to start afresh with you. I want us to turn over a new leaf—a clean slate—where I can prove to you that I am willing and ready to be the partner you deserve. I want to rebuild your trust and show you, not just with words but with consistent actions, how deeply I love and care for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is my pledge to you: To communicate better: I will make it a priority to call you frequently, check in on you, and share my thoughts and feelings openly with you, To show my love daily: Through small gestures and grand ones, I’ll ensure that you never have to question how much I love you, To listen more: I will truly hear you—your concerns, your needs and your dreams—and work to align our journey together and To never take you for granted: I will cherish every moment with you and treat our relationship as the treasure it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dell, you are an incredible woman—strong, kind and loving. You inspire me to be better every day, and I am grateful for the love you’ve given me despite my shortcomings. I want you to know that I am committed to growing and becoming the man you need me to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mistakes don’t define my love for you, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Let’s move forward together, stronger and more connected than ever. I promise to never let you down again, to never make you feel unimportant, and to love you with all that I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being you, Dell. You are my greatest blessing, and I am so lucky to have you in my life. Please forgive me, and let’s write this next chapter together—one filled with love, respect, and endless joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all my heart,<br>
        </p>
        <p>
