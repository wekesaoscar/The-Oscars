    <h1>The Oscars' Website Contents</h1>

    <p>This website contains information about so many subjects and all properties attributed
        to the respective subjects. Ultimately we will look through every single detail with
        respect to all subjects and further scruitinize them individually to understand their
        respective essence and importance as we run along this page and also trying to style
        the page effectively using the massive knowledge that we are acquiring from going
        through a complete CSS zero to hero tutorial video that helps us remember and also
        gather many more new attributed styles that we barely had any clue about whatsoever.

    <h2 class="title0">About Me</h2>

    <img src="../images/oscars.jpg" alt="The Oscars photo">

    <p>Basically The Oscars is a Computer Science student at Maasai mara University on a long
        holiday of 4 months after completing the first half of the course. Oscars is a very
        complex character who basically is obssessed with football and more specifically Chelsea
        related matters. Also I embrace family togetherness, understanding and most importantly
        paying very close attention to parents voice because so far i have seen how powerful a
        parent's voice is important through the success of my immediate elder sister Lavendah.
        Personally, I have great dreams and ambitions for myself both careerwise and footballwise.
        In summary, The Oscars has the following hobbies:
    <ul>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Cycling</li>
        <li>Adventuring</li>
        <li>Music</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Also the one very important thing that I also like doing is:
    <ul>
        <li>Helping my parents</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
